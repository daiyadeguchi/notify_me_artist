# notify_me_artist
This notifies me when my favorite artists announce Japan tour. I might make it flexible in the future, but the artists are hard coded for now.

Do I NEED to write this crawler? No.
Am I making anything better than exisiting notification in the website itself? No.
Am I having fun making it? Yes! So, that's good enough reason for me!
